# documentation
Some info one how things work

# Overview
Though some of the more technical documentation will be done directly in Github, a majority of the frontend documentation will take place by linking to the InVision screens.

- When a change to one of the dropdowns is made, the rooms below will automatically reload to accomodate for the new changes. E.g. if the price is changed from $250 - $300, to $300 - $350, the rooms below will reload according to the new price. This will not refresh the page, only the content.

- The homepage has an infinite scroll (the page should pre-load new rooms when the user is close to end of the existing lot of rooms displaying, in order to maintain a seamless scroll).

- The image at the top of the page will actually be a looped video of the city or country where people are accessing the website, to give it a very personalised feel.

- The text "Melbourne" is dynamic, and changes to the city the person accessing the website is located in, to again add a personalised experience.

- Clicking a heart adds the room to the users shortlist. If they're not logged in, the login prompt will come up. **(This is a future feature, and won't be included in the first release).**

- The price ranges are fixed values. The user cannot type a custom value. This is to simplify pricing across the website, and maintain conststent, readable, relatabel figures.

- The features dropdown consits of a tags-based-ui, whereby there are a variety of tags which can be clicked (to turn on / off). These tags act as filters. For example, if "Fast Internet" is selected, the rooms below will reload and only show rooms with fast internet, everything else will be excluded. After showing all queries that have an exact-match, e.g. having Fast Internet, show partial matches, e.g. rooms that might only meet the price selected. This is to eliminate showing blank search results.

- The "Where" / location field is auto-populated with the persons city (based on their IP data). When the user goes to change this value, there is a realtime, partial matching dropdown that speeds up searching for locations. Not only that, but the text itself will auto-expand in a slightly lighter colour (as seen in the design).

- Again, the weekly rent dropdown will have fixed pricing, which is the same pricing that is searchable on the homepage, for example.

- Initial bond is a fixed-value that the user cannot change (to simplify things). The initial bond should be auto-generated based on the rent value. **The formula is simply: rent x 4 = bond.**

- Home type and room type are all simple selectable buttons.

- Bathrooms is a fixed-value, numeretical dropdown that goes up to 9 bathrooms.

- Parking is a yes / no value (to keep things simple).

- Furnished is a yes / no value (to keep things simple).

- Place features uses the same tags system as seen on the homepage before. These are all pre-define values that the user cannot change. They are simple selectable buttons. All of these tags can be queried via search.

- Area features uses the same tags system as the above point; however, it takes it a step further by using these values to generate pins on a map (on the expanded listing page), where the user can see what is closeby to the room.

- About place is a simple textbox that is limited in characters to the amount in the design (might be nice to have a counter).
